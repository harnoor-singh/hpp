# hpp

A utility to conveniently compile and run C++ files.

## Installation Steps.

- Clone this directory.
- Optional: Change the directory name to h++
- Add the directory to a folder in PATH.
   - For example, in Linux, use `export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH`, if you have to add it in you home's bin directory, if existing.
   - Confirm with `echo $PATH`
   
- Go to the directory where the script is located. Then run `chmod a+x h++.sh`
- The script should be usable now.

## Usage

- If your filename is `assign1.cpp`, you run `h++ assign1`, without the cpp extension.
